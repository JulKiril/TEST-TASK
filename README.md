To build the project you need to have Node.js (Node) and Gulp installed onto your computer.
If you do not have Node installed already, you can get it by downloading the package installer from Node's website https://nodejs.org/en/.
To install Gulp use the command npm install --global gulp-cli
Create a project directory and navigate into it
